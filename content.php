	<p class="w3-row"><strong>The era that defined Wall Street is finally, officially
        over. Michael Lewis, who chronicled
        its excess in Liar's Poker, returns to his old
        haunt to figure out what went wrong.</strong></p>
    <p>To this day, the willingness of a Wall Street
        investment bank to pay me hundreds of
        thousands of dollars to dispense investment
        advice to grownups remains a mystery to me.
        I was 24 years old, with no experience of, or
        particular interest in, guessing which stocks
        and bonds would rise and which would fall.
        The essential function of Wall Street is to allocate
        capital—to decide who should get it and who should not. Believe me when I tell you that I hadn't the first clue.</p>
        <p>I’d never taken an accounting course, never run a business, never even had savings of my own to manage. I stumbled
        into a job at Salomon Brothers in 1985 and stumbled out much richer three years later, and even though I wrote a
        book about the experience, the whole thing still strikes me as preposterous—which is one of the reasons the money
        was so easy to walk away from. I figured the situation was unsustainable. Sooner rather than later, someone was going
        to identify me, along with a lot of people more or less like me, as a fraud. Sooner rather than later, there would
        come a Great Reckoning when Wall Street would wake up and hundreds if not thousands of young people like me,
        who had no business making huge bets with other people’s money, would be expelled from finance.</p>
	<p>When I sat down to write my account of the experience in 1989—Liar’s Poker, it was called—it was in the spirit of
a young man who thought he was getting out while the getting was good. I was merely scribbling down a message
on my way out and stuffing it into a bottle for those who would pass through these parts in the far distant future.
Unless some insider got all of this down on paper, I figured, no future human would believe that it happened.
I thought I was writing a period piece about the 1980s in America. Not for a moment did I suspect that the financial
1980s would last two full decades longer or that the difference in degree between Wall Street and ordinary life would
swell into a difference in kind. I expected readers of the future to be outraged that back in 1986, the C.E.O. of Salomon
Brothers, John Gutfreund, was paid $3.1 million; I expected them to gape in horror when I reported that one of
our traders, Howie Rubin, had moved to Merrill Lynch, where he lost $250 million; I assumed they’d be shocked to
learn that a Wall Street C.E.O. had only the vaguest idea of the risks his traders were running. What I didn’t expect
was that any future reader would look on my experience and say, "How quaint."</p>
